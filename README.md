# Calc


Calc is one of the simplest calculator app built using Kotlin for Android. It is a by-product of my Kotlin learning journey which I started during the COVID pandemic. All credit goes to the  **[#30DaysOfKotlin](https://eventsonair.withgoogle.com/events/kotlin)** initiative by Google to improve the understanding of Kotlin and apply it in real projects using Google resources (codelabs, sessions with Googlers) between 7th May, 2020 - 7th June, 2020. I got inspired by some of the great sessions by Googlers for this app.

You can get started with learning Kotlin just by setting it up on your local machine, and by playing a bit with the code.
